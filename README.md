# Snake by Blauker
This is my version of Snake game created with Python

# Controlls
A-> Move to the left <br />
S-> Move down <br />
D-> Move to the right <br />
W-> Move up <br />

# Install
You will need python 3.10+ <br/>
Download the zip and extract it anywhere <br/>
Since I used emojis ["ğŸŸ¥", "ğŸŸ§", "ğŸŸ¨", "ğŸŸ©", "ğŸŸ¦", "ğŸŸª", "ğŸŸ«"] to create the bg and snake, it wont run on cmd <br/>
You can run it easy on VSC <br/> <br/>

You need to be root on Linux, since I used keyboard lib <br/>
